# xinfo
xinfo is a simpler alternative to neofetch. Although not as visually appealing as neofetch, xinfo aims to provide a simple, easy to read system information output that is easily modifiable should the user know basic python.

**INSTALLATION**
- Download xinfo.py from this repository
- Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc): alias xinfo="python /path/to/file

**NOTES**
- Make sure not to clone the repository to /tmp. This will delete xinfo every time you boot your PC.
- At its base level, xinfo is very simple. It is expected that the user will make modifications that will suit their needs.
