# xinfo
xinfo is a simpler alternative to neofetch. Although not as visually appealing as neofetch, xinfo aims to provide a simple, easy to read system information output that is easily modifiable should the user know basic python. One notable advantage of xinfo is that, no matter what operating system you run, as long as it supports python, xinfo will just work.

**INSTALLATION**
- Clone this repository (preferably to the Downloads folder)
- Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc): alias xinfo="python /path/to/file (provide the path to xinfo.py)
